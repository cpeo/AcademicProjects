After the play, she turns to look at her dad on the sideline, sending him a smirk that says, “See, I can do it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

Just the day before, she saw some older kids dribble behind their back and wanted to try it. That's when her dad told her to stick to the basics, but even then, she was determined to make her game better. And that was when her dad knew she was on the right path.</span></p>

This would not be unusual for Shyanne, though, as she played up in higher levels constantly with her three older sisters throughout her early career.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>By her freshman year in high school, Shyanne had grown into herself as a player and was confident in her ball-handling and leadership abilities. In a game her freshman year, Shyanne’s older sister Shayla was unable to play and everyone in the stands was worried because this would be the first time Shyanne would play a high school game without her sister.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Shyanne said she has taken freshman Riley Nelson under her wing this season because she sees her younger self in Nelson. Her goal, Shyanne said, is to help the freshmen transition onto the team better and put them in a good headspace because she recognizes how important freshman players can be, especially for Maryland’s deep bench this season.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ever since she was little, Shyanne has always prioritized her team and teammates, according to her parents. Kym said Shyanne loves to be able to facilitate, that she likes pushing the ball off to her teammates and likes being able to be a playmaker. Shyanne averaged 2.6 assists per game her freshman year, 3.9 her sophomore year and 5.0 per game so far this season.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Her father said he knows Shyanne is growing into her role as a leader even more this season because he doesn’t get as many calls asking him what to do or how to solve a problem. He says her problem-solving skills, both on and off the court, have excelled and he is confident in her ability to lead the Maryland Women’s Basketball team to success.</span></p>

So, I think this year is the year that I am truly ready.”</span></p>
